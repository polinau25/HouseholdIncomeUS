# Household income in continental US
### Python project with geopandas mapping.
The project uses kaggle [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/claygendron/us-household-income-by-zip-code-2021-2011) on median and mean US household incomes.
Data is visualized using geopandas library and US census [shape files](https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2020/ZCTA520). The resulting map shows income by zip code.
Here is the resulting map: ![Map](images/Map.png?raw=true)
